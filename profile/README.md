# Duck Alignment Academy

Welcome to the GitHub organization for [Duck Alignment Academy](https://duckalignment.academy) â€” the world's leading (probably) source for structured leadership of open source projects.

The repositories in this organization mostly contain samples of project management and related assets for you to use.
Occassionally, I might share some code as well.
